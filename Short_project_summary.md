RePsyched is a comprehensive guide to recycling in Berlin, Germany. It is an interactive platform with a simple, easy-to-use interface where users can search for items and materials they want to dispose of and easily retrieve information on the appropriate waste bin, recycling yard, or donation point â€” with the locations nearest to the user conveniently marked on a map. The RePsyched prototype was built by an interdisciplinary team of eight people from the User Experience Design, Data Science and Web Development tracks to address the need for reliable location-specific information on waste separation and disposal in Germany's capital city.

During the project phase of the TechLabs Digital Shaper Program, RePsyched project participants gained hands-on experience leveraging their tech skills to turn an initial idea into a working website. The UX Designers applied user research, scenario and persona development techniques and designed an interactive prototype in Figma. The Data Scientists scraped, cleaned, and evaluated online data for the website utilizing the Python frameworks Scrapy and Beautiful Soup. The Web Developers implemented the working prototype of the website using the WebDev toolbox including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and React. The team worked closely together using Zoom, Slack and GitHub to effectively collaborate.
